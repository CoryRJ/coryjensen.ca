				<h4>What is swing dancing?</h4>
				<p>
					Swing dancing was popular from 1920-1940, though some people still do it today. It mostly includes partner dances like Lindy Hop and East Coast Swing but also
					has some solo dances like Charleston. Swing dancing uses jazz music, often the Big Band subgenre. All in all, Swing Dancing is a great way to socialize, have fun and to get some exercise.

				<h4>My experience with swing dancing:</h4>
				<p>
					I started swing dancing in 2011 and still do it today, of course I take a break every now and then for a couple months.
					Swing dancing is a fun way to get your cardio in as you socialize. In many larger cities there is often a swing dance 
					club you can go to, and it is always a friendly environment with welcoming people - at least, in my experience. If you
					have never tried it, I highly encourage you look up a club near you and give it a try.

				<h4>What do I like to learn?</h4>
				<p>
					I typically like learning about anything science related, usually focusing on specific topics. I typically enjoy learning about mathematics, physics, biology, fitness and health related things, and some other topics. <br/>
					I dont learn about all of these at once, of course.
				</p>
			</div>

		<div class='table_row'>
			<div class='table_cell'>
				<h4>What am I learning about right now?</h4>
				<p>
					The above is a list of the topics that I am generally interested in, I often find I switch from learning one thing to another every so often. I am currently watching lectures on Youtube about human behaviour by Dr Robert Sapolsky, many different videos about Neural Networks and some lectures about the intricacies of fantasy writing by Brandon Sanderson. Bellow are two of those topics that I have been focusing more on than the rest:
				</p>
				<div class='table_row'>
					<div class='table_cell'>
						<h4>
							The intricacies of writing fantasy
						</h4>
						<p>
							Since I entered high school I have been very interested in the fantasy genre.
							The worlds I read about and the characters I met always seemed to help me get by.
							Because of this, I have a strong desire to write my own story so I have been
							watching Brandon Sandersons lectures on fantasy book writing on Youtube. I have,
							of course, been writing on my own as well but I havent written anything that I
							think is good enough yet. Though that has been the case, I am going to continue
							to write in pursuit of this dream- I find it becomes more enjoyable the more I
							write.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class='table_cell'>
						<h4>
							Neural Networks
						</h4>
						<p>
							I have been mystified by Neural Networks from the moment I heard about them.
							I was eager to learn about them in University, but am sad to say I never got
							the opportunity to learn about it. So, I took it upon myself to go and teach
							myself and it has been very much a success so far. I made a NN based off of
							the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits that recognizes handwritten digits.
							You can see this program in the projects section on this website! Now that
							I understand how backpropagation works, I am going to teach myself how to
							use Tensor Flow as well as many of the other types of NN's.

				<h4>My experience in reading:</h4>
				<p>
					I started reading consistently around grade 9. The first fantasy series that became one of my favourites is The Wheel of Time 
					by Robert Jordan. It was an amazing series and it gave me a very good impression on the 
					fantasy genre - specifically, it made me love long series, it has 16 books, and the epic fantasy subgenre.

				<h4>What books do I recommend?</h4>
				<div class='table_row'>
					<div class='table_cell'>
						<h4>
							Mistborn, by Brandon Sanderson
						</h4>
						<p>
							Brandon Sanderson finished off The Wheel of Time when Robert Jordan passed away.
							After reading the books in the series that he finished, I decided to check out 
							this Brandon guy. One of the first series of his that I read was the Mistborn 
							series. I highly recommend this book, I love the characters even after having
							read it so long ago. The setting is in a post apocalyptic world after the hero 
							has already lost to the villian.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class='table_cell'>
						<h4>
							Assassin's Apprentice, by Robin Hobb
						</h4>
						<p>
							I very recently started reading Robin Hobbs books, and I am not disappointed.
							This series starts out with a boy being dropped off at a keep. This boy is
							the illigitamate son of the king in waiting, and is now being taken care of
							by those who were close to his father. He is eventually brought into the castle
							and is trained as an assassin. This is a very good series, I actually started
							out with the later books in the series and you wont be disappointed.

				<h4>What is bouldering?</h4>
				<p>
					In bouldering, you climb on a wall, often slanted in a way that tries to mimic
					some cliffs, that has man made hand holds drilled into it.
					There are routes that are color coded in which you must climb through 
					using only the allowed hand holds, with varying levels of difficulty.
				</p>

		<div class='table_row'>
			<div class='table_cell'>
				<h4>My experience with bouldering:</h4>
				<p>
					I started bouldering in 2015 at the University of Calgary. It is a 
					very fun way to socialize, get a forearm workout, and an upper body
					work out if you climb in a more tiring way. There are bouldering walls
					in most large cities and I recommend that you go and try it out.

				<h4>My experience with exercise:</h4>
				<p>
					Since grade 9 I have nearly always tried to stay in shape outside of the hobbies that I do.
					From grade 9 to university, I typically tried to go to the gym at least twice a week
					though of course I would take breaks every once in a while. These days, I go and workout 
					about four out of every five days. I recently accomplished two of my fitness goals, those being 40 pull ups in 3 sets and 20 pull ups in 1 set.

				<h4>My fitness goals:</h4>
				<div class='table_row'>
					<div class='table_cell'>
						<h4>
							Human flag for 5 seconds	
						</h4>
						<p>
							After having accomplished my previous goals, I discovered I was able
							to do a poor human flag for 2 seconds. When I found this I out, I 
							have since been working hard at shoulder and core exercises to get the amount of time I can do this up.
							I have since improved to being able to do a good human flag for about 3 seconds.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class='table_cell'>
						<h4>
							Hold a front lever for 5 seconds
						</h4>
						<p>
							A front lever is an exercise where you hold onto a bar that is above you
							and you lift your torso up so that it is perfectly straight and level with
							the ground. I am able to hold this for about 5 seconds if I have one leg tucked up into my chest,
							and am able to raise my body up and hold for 1 with my body straight but knees bent. I am still
							far from this goal, but I get closer every week.
