				<h4>What is swing dancing?</h4>
				<p>
					Swing dancing was popular from 1920-1940, though some people still do it today. It mostly includes partner dances like Lindy Hop and East Coast Swing but also
					has some solo dances like Charleston. Swing dancing uses jazz music, often the Big Band subgenre. All in all, Swing Dancing is a great way to socialize, have fun and to get some exercise.

				<h4>My experience with swing dancing:</h4>
				<p>
					I started swing dancing in 2011 and still do it today, of course I take a break every now and then for a couple months.
					Swing dancing is a fun way to get your cardio in as you socialize. In many larger cities there is often a swing dance 
					club you can go to, and it is always a friendly environment with welcoming people - at least, in my experience. If you
					have never tried it, I highly encourage you look up a club near you and give it a try.

				<h4>What topics am I interested in?</h4>

				<h4>What am I learning about right now?</h4>

					The above list are the topics that interest, so I am not learning about all of them at the same time but usually weave back and forth through them. Lately, I have been learning:<br/>

				<div class='table_row'>
					<div class='table_cell'>
						<h4>
							How to write fantasy books
						</h4>
						<p>
							It has always been a dream of mine to 
							write my own book, and I want to start trying. I have written several pages so 
							far and am currently trying to come up with an outline.
							I have been watching many lectures online by Brandon Sanderson, my favourite author, on 
							some of the intricacies in writing fantasy.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class='table_cell'>
						<h4>
							Neural Networks
						</h4>
						<p>
							I think AI is very cool, I have wanted to learn about it since before I came to university
							but didnt get the chance to during my bachelors degree. So, lately I have been researching
							the different kinds of neural nets and how back propogation works. I intend on making a 
							neural network soon, possible a NEAT algorithm based off <a href="http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf">this</a>
							paper. I took a break from learning about this to learn how to make this website.

				<h4>My experience in reading:</h4>
				<p>
					I started reading consistently around grade 9. The first fantasy series that became one of my favourites is The Wheel of Time 
					by Robert Jordan. It was an amazing series and it gave me a very good impression on the 
					fantasy genre - specifically, it made me love long series, it has 16 books, and the epic fantasy subgenre.

				<h4>What books do I recommend?</h4>
				<div class='table_row'>
					<div class='table_cell'>
						<h4>
							Mistborn, by Brandon Sanderson
						</h4>
						<p>
							Brandon Sanderson finished off The Wheel of Time when Robert Jordan passed away.
							After reading the books in the series that he finished, I decided to check out 
							this Brandon guy. One of the first series of his that I read was the Mistborn 
							series. This book is a YA style book, but I recommend it none the less. The characters
							live in a post apocalyptic world after the hero already lost to the villian.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class='table_cell'>
						<h4>
							Fool's Assassin, by Robin Hobb
						</h4>
						<p>
							I very recently started reading Robin Hobbs books, and I am not disappointed.
							The star of Fool's Assassin is a 50 ish year old man, and ex-assassin, named FitzChivalry Farseer.
							Fitz is living out his older years with his wife out in a peaceful country when dramatic
							events start to occur. This may have a bit of a slow start for some people, but I 
							relished the pace of this book myself.

				<h4>What is bouldering?</h4>
				<p>
					In bouldering, you climb on a wall, often slanted in a way that tries to mimic
					some cliffs, that has man made hand holds drilled into it.
					There are routes that are color coded in which you must climb through 
					using only the allowed hand holds, with varying levels of difficulty.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class='table_row'>
			<div class='table_cell'>
				<h4>My experience with bouldering:</h4>
				<p>
					I started bouldering in 2015 at the University of Calgary. It is a 
					very fun way to socialize, get a forearm workout, and an upper body
					work out if you climb in a more tiring way. There are bouldering walls
					in most large cities and I recommend that you go and try it out.

				<h4>My experience with exercise:</h4>
				<p>
					Since grade 9 I have nearly always tried to stay in shape outside of the hobbies that I do.
					From grade 9 to university, I typically tried to go to the gym at least twice a week
					though of course I would take breaks every once in a while. These days, I go and workout 
					about four out of every five days. I recently accomplished two of my fitness goals, those being 40 pull ups in 3 sets and 20 pull ups in 1 set.

				<h4>My fitness goals:</h4>
				<div class='table_row'>
					<div class='table_cell'>
						<h4>
							Human flag for 5 seconds	
						</h4>
						<p>
							After having accomplished my previous goals, I discovered I was able to do a poor human flag for 2 seconds. When I found this I out, I have since been working hard at shoulder and core exercises to get the amount of time I can do this up.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class='table_cell'>
						<h4>
							Hold a front lever for 5 seconds
						</h4>
						<p>
							A front lever is an exercise where you hold onto a bar that is above you
							and you lift your torso up so that it is perfectly straight and level with
							the ground. I am able to hold this for about 3 seconds if I have one leg tucked up into my chest, so I still have a ways to go until I accomplish this goal.
